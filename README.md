# Rules For Young Programmers

Following Robert Schumann's [Rules For Young Musicians](https://jmm.people.si.umich.edu/blog/schumann%27s_rules_for_young_musicians.pdf) in merit and style, here's a set of maxims and aphorisms for aspiring and practicing programmers alike, in no particular order. As stated in the foreword to the original article:

> Once you have read them, you will find yourself reading them again and again, finding the wisdom they contain more absorbing and rewarding each time.

## I

The most important thing is to cultivate the sense of Seeing. Take pains early to embrace understanding while sightreading, as reading code makes the most of the programmer's work.

## II

Each code editor has syntax highlighting – use it to spot functions, control statements and loops before you see them.

## III

Develop a strict discipline of writing your code in a consistent manner. For a seasoned programmer, every indentation or empty line matters and makes sightreading easier.

## IV

Lehman's classification of [S-programs, P-programs and E-programs](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/education/SE-Intro/lehman.pdf) is a very useful concept. They are highly correlated with Clear, Complicated and Complex domains in the Cynefin framework.

## V

Strive to write S-Programs well and beautifully; it is necessary for a practicioner to be able to write rock solid, fast and small programs, rather than a mediocre large system.

## VI

Algorithms are good examples of S-Programs. If you're looking for a next exercise, try to implement and then understand the inner workings of an algorithm in the language of your choosing.

## VII

In real life, scaffolding doesn't stay with the building when it's completed. Don't fool yourself, it's a wrong metaphor. A better one would be of a skeleton.

## VIII

A young programmer practices program designs that can be understood by other programmers; you'll keep the rest of your career practicing designs that can be understood by anyone.

## IX

If you believe there's only one way to accomplish a certain task, only one framework, only one language or only one programming paradigm, then it's the same as believing there's only one way to structure a sentence with given meaning in the English language.

## X

Avoid mixing up declarative and imperative code. It's like answering the question "Where are you going for holidays?" with "Well, for starters I'm going to check the oil level in my car engine".

## XI

There's a confusion in the meaning of the `=` symbol. A mathematician might say this determines equality between two sides. A functional programmer might say it's about binding a name to a value. An imperative programmer will say that's assignment operator that mutates the program state.

## XII

Acquaint yourself early with the idea that any program you wrote will be studied by others and it's your responsibility to teach them to orient themselves in your code. Each program constitutes an act of teaching.

## XIII

Never write tests for how the code was written. Write tests for how it's going to be used.

## XIV

A good metaphor for the reactive programming paradigm is electricity. You are not interested in the principles that make the current flow inside the wire, you expect to just connect the wires to make things work.

## XV

Acquire early a skill to compare and concatenate paths by eye. Many programmers spent hours just to find out their program is not pointing to the right file, directory or a network address.

## XVI

Learn to seek for the precise terminology and use it deliberately. For example, a procedure and a function may seem similar, but there's a consequence in the meaning and application of each one.
